#declaring a new class -- this is how you create a new type
#there are built in types - number, string, bool; if we want to create our own type, we create a class
#a class is made up of the built in types 

#definition

#the init function here is called a constructor -- it constructs a new instance of this class
#its constructed from built in types - hence the constructor 
#a constructor is a function that creates the object / an instance of a class




#you use square brackets for an array in pretty much all languages
#an array is just a list of many things that you assign to a variable
#its a list of a type of object

#in programming arrays start at 0 not 1 -- the first item in the list is zero, the second item in the list is one -- zero is the first digit






# definition vs. instance
# definition -- we are declaring a new class, creating a new type using the class keyword
# a class has a constructor/initializer. this is a function that gets called when creating an instance of this type 
#
# instance -- we could have one or many instances of our type 
# think apple -- we have the definition, which is found in a dictionary,
# and we have our instance, which is in our kitchen

#Reminder: arrays next lesson


#this is perfect.
#this just became a great lesson.

#Scalabiltiy 

#a constructor is the initialization function of a class 
#its the function that gets called when you create an instance of a class / object
